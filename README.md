# Why I'm Choosing this project?

I'm choosing this project because it aligns perfectly with my skills as a blockchain and web3 developer. The project involves creating a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to conduct open or invite-based elections using different voting algorithms. I'm excited to be a part of this project because it will allow me to explore various blockchain technologies like Alchemy API, Ether.js, and Web3.js.

The flexibility and user experience offered by this DApp also appeal to me. The open and invite-based features make it versatile, and it can be used for various types of elections. Additionally, being a part of an open-source community like AOSSIE gives me a chance to collaborate with other developers and work on exciting projects that can have a real-world impact.


# Do you have any commitments during the GSoC Period?

I am currently not committed to any other projects or obligations during the GSoC period, which means I am fully available to dedicate my time and effort towards contributing to this project.

# How many hours will you work per week?

 I plan to dedicate at least 15 hours per week to this project.
 

# About Me

I'm Yash Dewasthale, a 3rd year Electrical Engineering student from MITS College Gwalior, India, and a passionate web3 and open source DevRel. I'm currently working as a web3 freelancer and dedicating my work to the open source and developer communities. I'm also the founder of BuildersChain, a developer community focused on open source web3 and DevRel. Our mission is to help developers get familiar with open source and web3, and we host a variety of events to help community members learn from experts and professionals.

In addition to my community work, I'm a skilled web3 developer with technical expertise in JS, NodeJS, Solidity, EtherJS, Web3JS, Ganache, Etherscan, and Alchemy API. I'm currently working with Alchemy as a Growth Contractor, where I'm helping the team and community grow faster and better. My work with Alchemy has given me deep insights into the Ethereum ecosystem and helped me develop a deep understanding of how to optimize blockchain-based applications.

Currently, I'm also working on a decentralized exchange platform DApp with my community, leveraging my skills in Alchemy API, Solidity, Web3JS, and other blockchain technologies to create an innovative and user-friendly platform that can empower users to exchange tokens in a decentralized and secure manner.
