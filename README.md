# Why I'm Choosing this project?

I'm choosing this project because it aligns perfectly with my skills as a blockchain and web3 developer. The project involves creating a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to conduct open or invite-based elections using different voting algorithms. I'm excited to be a part of this project because it will allow me to explore various blockchain technologies like Alchemy API, Ether.js, and Web3.js.

The flexibility and user experience offered by this DApp also appeal to me. The open and invite-based features make it versatile, and it can be used for various types of elections. Additionally, being a part of an open-source community like AOSSIE gives me a chance to collaborate with other developers and work on exciting projects that can have a real-world impact.


# Do you have any commitments during the GSoC Period?

I am currently not committed to any other projects or obligations during the GSoC period, which means I am fully available to dedicate my time and effort towards contributing to this project.

# How many hours will you work per week?

 I plan to dedicate at least 15 hours per week to this project.
